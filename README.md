## Project Overview

This repository houses the implementation framework for my master's thesis on optimizing Base Transceiver Station (BTS) site planning through advanced machine learning techniques enhanced by high-performance computing. The research demonstrates how telecommunications operators can significantly improve network efficiency, coverage quality, and operational resource allocation through sophisticated clustering analysis of network performance data.

## Research Context

Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) form the critical foundation of mobile network infrastructure, delivering essential connectivity services across diverse geographical landscapes. Modern telecommunications networks generate enormous volumes of operational data containing valuable optimization insights, but require advanced computational methods for effective analysis.

This research specifically addresses:
- The growing challenge of BTS management in increasingly complex network environments
- The Algerian telecommunications sector's unique optimization requirements
- How machine learning can support data-driven decision-making for infrastructure planning
- Optimization across regions with varying population densities, usage patterns, and environmental conditions
